# CubeCurtain

This project uses a 64oz.in. stepper motor to raise and lower a curtain, sized to block the face of
an annoying or distracting coworker.  This curtain does not block sound, but that's what headphones are for.  

The motor is driven by a L298N-based dual full bridge motor driver.  The motor driver is controlled with
an arduino uno, which is receiving inputs through two momentary tacticle buttons.
